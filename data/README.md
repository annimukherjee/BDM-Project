In this project, I have utilized publicly available datasets from the California Department of Health Care Access and Information (HCAI) to conduct a comprehensive analysis of emergency department operations, capacity constraints, and utilization patterns across California hospitals.

### 2.1	Hospital Emergency Department Encounters by Facility (2012-2024)
- **Link**: https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/hospital-emergency-department-encounters-by-facility

- **Description**: This dataset provides comprehensive facility-level data on ED utilization across California from 2012 to 2024. It includes annual aggregates of ED encounters covering 440 unique facilities across 56 counties.


### 2.2	Emergency Department Volume and Capacity (2021-2023)
- **Link**: https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/emergency-department-volume-and-capacity
  

- **Description**: This dataset captures detailed operational metrics for California emergency departments from 2021 to 2023. It includes facility-level information on total ED visits, number of treatment stations, calculated burden ratios (visits per station), geographic classification (urban/rural/frontier), and hospital ownership type.

By using these datasets, this project aims to acquire a comprehensive understanding of California's emergency department operations, identify critical capacity constraints and utilization trends, and offer actionable insights. These insights are intended to enhance strategic capacity planning, optimize resource allocation, and improve emergency care delivery across the state's healthcare system.
